<h1>Darwin’s data</h1>



<p>A scientific study consists of document(s) specifying a population, question, hypothesis, experimental design, experimenter, data, analysis plan, analyst, code, parameter estimates, and claims about the parameter estimates (Patil et al., 2016)</p>
<p>Charles Darwin collected data over a period of years on the heights of Zea mays plants.</p>

<h3>Population</h3>
<p>Zea mays plants</p>

<div id="darwins-hypothesis" class="section level3">
<h3>Darwin’s hypothesis</h3>
<p>Height of a plant depends on the type of fertilization.</p>
</div>
<div id="experimental-design" class="section level3">
<h3>Experimental Design</h3>
<p>The plants were descended from the same parents and planted at the same time. Half of the plants were <em>self-fertilized</em>, and half were <em>cross-fertilized</em>, and the purpose of the experiment was to compare their <em>heights</em> (measured in eighths of an inch). To this end Darwin planted them in pairs in different pots.</p>
<p>The focus of interest is the relation between the height of a plant and something that can be controlled by the experimenter, namely whether it is self or cross-fertilized. This means that you can regard the height as random with a distribution that depends on the type of fertilization, which is fixed for each plant.</p>
<p>Note that in order to minimize differences in humidity, growing conditions, lighting, etc. Darwin had decided to plant the seeds in pairs in the same pots. The height of a plant would therefore also depend on these factors, which are not of interest, not only on the type of fertilization.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Does height depend on the type of fertilization?</p></li>
<li><p>Could you estimate the height difference, and assess the uncertainty of the estimate?</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="task" class="section level2">
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Answer 1. and 2. by specifying</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis Plan</strong>: Define a statistical model, and be very specific about the required assumptions. The less the assumptions the better. You can use different models to answer 1 and 2.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong>: Write the R code to get the results. You can add plots, statistical summaries, etc. Your code must be replicable.</li>
<li><strong>Claim:</strong> Comment your results and write your conclusions about 1 and 2.</li>
</ul>
