<h1>Homework 2</h1>



<p>A researcher attempts to determine if a certain treatment has an effect on a particular disease.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of the disease was measured in 21 individuals before and after the treatment.</p>
<pre><code>              Before treatment After treatment
Individual 1  &quot;No Disease&quot;     &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 2  &quot;Disease&quot;        &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 3  &quot;No Disease&quot;     &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 4  &quot;Disease&quot;        &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 5  &quot;No Disease&quot;     &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 6  &quot;No Disease&quot;     &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 7  &quot;Disease&quot;        &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 8  &quot;Disease&quot;        &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 9  &quot;Disease&quot;        &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 10 &quot;No Disease&quot;     &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 11 &quot;No Disease&quot;     &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 12 &quot;Disease&quot;        &quot;Disease&quot;      
Individual 13 &quot;No Disease&quot;     &quot;No Disease&quot;   
Individual 14 &quot;No Disease&quot;     &quot;Disease&quot;

Individual 21 &quot;Disease&quot;        &quot;No Disease&quot;   </code></pre>
<p>For these data, test the null hypothesis of no effect of the treatment, and compute the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value.</p>
