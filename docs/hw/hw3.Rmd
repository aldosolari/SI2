Let $X_i$ denotes test statistic for the $i$th hypothesis, and assume that $X = (X_1,..., X_m)'$ is multivariate normal with $X_i \sim N(\mu_i, 1)$ and known covariance matrix $\Sigma$ with diagonal elements 1 and off-diagonal elements $\rho$. Let $\mu = (\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_m)'$. Assume that the parameter space is given by $\Omega = \{\mu \in \mathbb{R}^m: \mu_i \geq 0\}$.

Find the uniformly most powerful test of $\mu=0$ against alternatives $\mu = (\tilde{\mu},\ldots,\tilde{\mu})'$.
