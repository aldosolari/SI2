Hypothesis testing is concerned with statistical testing of postulates (usually concerning parameters) in an empirical way, i.e., from data. 
This subject is fundamental in statistical inference. The course aims to introduce students to modern ideas in hypothesis testing, ranging from classical significance tests to post-selection inference.
