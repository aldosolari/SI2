The rules are the following:

* You will have to submit your solution by the deadline

* Answer with clarity and precision. R code (if any) must be reproducible

* For theoretical questions, provide a well-reasoned mathematical argument. Simulations can help form your intuition; but a purely empirical answer will only receive partial points

* Use of sources (people, books, internet and so on) without citing them in homework sets results in negative grade

* You must follow a code of conduct, which covers issues such as plagiarism, falsification, unauthorized assistance, cheating, and other grievous acts of academic dishonesty


## Exam

The final grade will be based on 

* Homework assignments

* Oral examination
